# Mystery YAML Maker Helper Thing

This is a forked project to add additional fields and adjust default weights for my personal multiworld community.


FORKED from: https://github.com/qadan/qadan.github.io  (Which can be used at: qadan.github.io )

Makes use of [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) to actually do the
thing.
